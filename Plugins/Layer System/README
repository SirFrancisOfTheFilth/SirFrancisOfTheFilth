Behold! The layer system!

Using this plugin system, you can render as many layers over or under units as you want. No more dancing around
with 2 mapchips per tile! You and you alone decide how many is too many! Want units to be able to hide behind
the terrain? Go ahead! Shape the map to your liking with the layer system.

The LayerRenderer is the brain of the layer system. It coordinates the other two plugins and is used for
settings.

The third layer plugin is adapted from RogueClaris' third layer plugin, but heavily modified with lots of
improvements. It renders mapchips with a certain custom parameter over units.

Unlimited layers makes it possible to render more than 2 mapchip images to the same coordinates. In fact,
the number of images is unlimited, as the name suggests. It is even possible to render third layer tiles
with this plugin.

The folder inside the included .zip file (FotF_UnlimitedLayers.zip) needs to be placed inside the Material
folder of your project. It contains essential files and the game will not start if they're missing.
DO NOT REMOVE, RENAME OR RELOCATE THE FOLDER OR FILES INSIDE!
